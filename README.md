Baanplanner to Meyton

This is a simple Bash script that converts an export from baanplanner.eu to a Meyton starting list so baanplanner exports can be converted and used to feed the Meyton Startliste feature.

This script makes several assumptions based on our situation:
- Discipline is derived out of the Houding-variable and is a custom field on baanplanner.eu, so our disciplines are used for conversion
- Serie is derived from our starting times and slot times so these need to be adjusted to your starting times and series.
  
Start the script in BASH and give it the registration list as argument. The registration list should be an export of the list generated by baanplanner.eu and separated by a semi-colon (;).
The script will generate a series of files containing the startlist per serie, and tarball the series for easy copying to the Meyton match computer.

Two versions have been made: An international version, and a Dutch version.

TODO:
- Find a way co convert Series based on the number of series and then self-generate the series
- Find a way to make sure disciplines are filtered correctly, perhaps fill the Houding field in Baanplanner with the corresponding Meyton ID?
